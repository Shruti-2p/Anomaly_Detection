# Anomaly Detection Using Autoencoder

This repository contains a project for detecting anomalies in images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Autoencoder. The primary use case demonstrated here is the detection of faults (e.g., holes) in carpet textures, but the approach can be adapted for other types of image anomaly detection.
